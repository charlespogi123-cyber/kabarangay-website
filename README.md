## Bootstrap via CDN

This project uses Bootstrap for responsive design by loading CSS and JS files from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This ensures faster load times and always up-to-date files, without the need to store Bootstrap assets locally.

## Developer Documentation

### Workflow & Collaboration

- **Branching:**  
  Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix (e.g., `feature/admin-dashboard`, `bugfix/request-tracking`).

- **Commits:**  
  Use clear and descriptive commit messages referencing what was changed.

- **Pull Requests:**  
  Open a pull request for each new feature or fix. Assign teammates for code review.

- **Testing:**  
  Test all new and changed functionality in both user and admin sections before merging.

- **Code Style:**  
  Keep HTML, CSS, and JS modular and organized. Use comments in code for complex logic. Place shared elements in `partials/` for reusability.

### Editing Content and Admin Pages

- To update announcements or officials, edit the relevant JSON in `data/`.
- Modify admin layouts in their respective `admin-*` HTML files.
- For reusable navigation, footer, or forms, update the related partial in `partials/` and verify JavaScript loads them correctly.
- Always check your changes in the browser before submitting or merging.

### Notes for Future Developers

- Consistently use Bootstrap classes for layout and interface elements.
- Structure JavaScript in small, maintainable functions with meaningful names.
- Keep CDN links up-to-date with the latest Bootstrap version as needed.
- Refer to this README for onboarding, workflow steps, and project file structure.
